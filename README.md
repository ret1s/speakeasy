## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
SpeakEasy, a messaging application, draws inspiration from Zalo, the widely recognized Vietnamese messaging platform. It serves as a project component within the author's Software Architecture course, where emphasis is placed not only on its development but also on its architectural design and implementation. Through this endeavor, SpeakEasy aims to offer an educational exploration of modern messaging app architectures while incorporating features reminiscent of Zalo's functionality and user experience.
